                    Typically, the experience of Bipolar Mood is described by periods that fluctuate between intense exhilaration and periods of significant depression.

                    <p>Depending on the severity of these experiences, it often occurs that people with Bipolar Mood experience changes in sleep patterns, productivity, and are more likely to take part in risky and impulsive behaviours (unwarranted purchases, drunk driving etc).</p>

                <p class = blurb>
                    There are many perspectives that discuss the etiology of Bipolar Mood, yet it is not fully understood.
                    The main perspectives are:
                    <p><li><b>Developmental perspectives:</b> which suggest that there is an interplay between the environmental (nurtured) and hereditary (natural) elements that a person experiences which inspire Bipolar Moods. </li></p>
                    <p><li><b>Neuropsychological perspectives:</b> which suggest that neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine play a role in the experience of Bipolar Mood. These factors are informed by sleep patterns (and other biological rhythms) which can impact a persons mood.</li></p>
