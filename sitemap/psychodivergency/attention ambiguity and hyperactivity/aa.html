                <p class = blurb>
                    <p>Attentional Ambiguity and Hyperactivity (AARH) more commonly known as Attention Defecit and Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), is described by difficulty in sustaining attention and controlling impulsive behaviours when unstimulated.</p>
                    <p>It often occurs that people are not able to complete tedious activites that are required of them. However, when one experiences profound AARH, greater difficulties in focusing and implementing goal directed behavior is impacted.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: -20px; font-size: medium;">Why do people experience Attention Ambiguity & Hyperactivity?</p>
                <p class = blurb>
                    There are many perspectives that discuss the etiology of Attention Ambiguity & Hyperactivity Mood, however the causes are unknown and research is inconsistent.
                    
                    <p style="font-size: medium;margin-bottom: 0px;">Perspectives include:</p>
                    <li><b>Neuropsychological perspectives:</b> suggest that divergencies in brain structure and activation play a role in the experience of AAH. These divergencies are linked with thrill-seeking and novelty and provide insight into the hyperactivity and aversion to tedious work that people with AAH experience.</li>
                    <li><b>Developmental perspectives:</b> suggest that there is an interplay between the environmental (nurtured) and hereditary (natural) elements that a person experiences which inspire the experience. </li>

                <p class="blurb"> The best way to maintain positive mental health is by ensuring you are sleeping in a routine and considerate of the things you consume (media and food). This is because the neurochemistry of the mind depends on sleep, good health and positivity to excel.</p>
