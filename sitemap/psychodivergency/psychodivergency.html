                <p>Psychodivergence is a term used to describe individuals whose psychological development and cognition differ from what is considered typical.</p>
                <p>Psychodivergence manifests in diverse ways. One individual might openly express their emotions and anxieties, while another may remain vigilant, closely scrutinizing the intentions of their peers and another might display apathy towards matters that would concern others.</p>
                
                <p>The concept of psychodiversity challenges the notion of labeling differences as disorders. Instead, it advocates for the viewing of psychodivergency as a natural and valuable aspect of human diversity.</p>
