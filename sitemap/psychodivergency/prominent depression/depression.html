            <p class = blurb>
                <p>Depression is a state of persistent sadness and loss of interest (even in things that usually bring pleasure). When a person experiences Major Depression, they are not able to continue with day to day activites owing to the fatigue that accompanies a depressed mood.</p>
                    <p>At the same time people are likely to reinforce and maintain behaviors that encourage lethargy and decreased ambition like eating less, inconsistent sleeping and rehearsing negative cognitions of themselves and existence.</p>

                        <b>Neuropsychological perspectives:</b>
                        suggest that a balance in neurochemicals (dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine) plays a role in mood and volition.
                        The balance is informed by sleep patterns (and other biological rhythms) which can impact a persons mood.
                        When these chemicals are out of balance then a person may be vulnerable to Major Depression and other threats to mental-health.

                            <b>Cognitive perspectives:</b> suggest that it is the negative aprraisals of a situation that prevent positive behaviors.
                            This appraisal prevents behavior that would've ammended the situation that needed to change.
                            The repetition of negative appraisals form a bias that prevent positive behaviors that benefit the pursuit of one's ambitions.
